# accounting-services/auth

Serves API end-points for any operations (creation, updation, deletion etc.) on organization accounts and users. It's named auth since it takes care of both authentication and authorisation.

## Development

> ðŸš§ **Warning**
>
> It is currently not possible for developers not associated with Normative to
> start this service as it requires access to protected resources.

### One time Set-up

One time set-up, for system dependencies such as nvm and npm. Before beginning, ensure [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) is installed and you're a member of [npmjs.com/org/normative](https://www.npmjs.com/org/normative).

```sh
$ nvm use
$ npm login # login to personal npm account
$ nvm install-latest-npm
```

### Environment Setup

Make a copy of `.env.sample`, fill the values (ex: MONGO_URI) and save as `.env.dev` in the same folder.

### Local server

```sh
$ nvm use
$ npm install
$ npm start auth # running on localhost:5000
```

### Running unit tests

Tests are written using [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

```sh
$ nvm use
$ npm run test auth
```
